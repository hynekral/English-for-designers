## Corporate identity of People in Need Centre ##

In my Bachelor thesis I am going to create a new visual identity and communication of the Langhans Center, which is a center of People in Need - the largest non-profit organization in Central Europe. It is situated in the very centre of Prague, near the Václavské náměstí. This centre has been operating since 2011 and exists to connect the general public and the organization People in Need. It provides a number of lectures, exhibitions, workshops, screenings, concerts and others in order to educate, enrich and entertain.
