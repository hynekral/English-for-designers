## About 


I am a graphic and media design student. I consider myself to be open-minded, creative, and with a sense of punctuality. I am passionate about all forms of art but mostly about design and photography. I think of myself as a positive and communicative person with a sense of empathy. I have no problem working in a team and I am always excited to learn new things. I’m a hard worker and I don’t like to do things at the last minute.

I enjoy traveling and getting to know other cultures and people. During my high school studies, I traveled abroad twice for half a year. First I spent 6 months in the US where I attended high school in Colorado. Two years later I visited Australia. Both of these experiences thought me independence, problem-solving ability, and the ability to work in a multicultural setting. One of my other passions in life is swimming so don't be surprised when you run into me with wet hair.
