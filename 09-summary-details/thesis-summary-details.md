## Abstract

This bachelor's thesis deals with the creation of a visual communication concept for the People in Need Center, the Langhans Center. The thesis contains an explanation of concepts such as corporate identity, logo, typography, pictogram, wayfinding system, color or SWOT analysis.

Besides, it describes the establishment and activities of the non-profit organization People in Need. The work describes the history of the Langhans Palace building, in which the Langhans Center is located, and its reconstruction.

In the practical part of the thesis, an analysis of the current state of the subject is performed and the determined direction by which the visual communication concept will be processed is set. The problem of the naming of the subject and the communication language is solved here as well. It describes the creation of a unified visual style from the design of the logo, color pallete setting, choice of typography, creation of pictograms, to the implementation of these elements in marketing communication.

The aim of the work is to create a comprehensive visual communication concept while bringing attention to the existence of the Langhans Center among the general public. The possible implementation of the new concept should then tap into the space’s potential and make it more attractive. This should then lead to a shift in the public perception of the Langhans Center from being seen as a simple café to serving as a multifunctional space for professionals and ordinary people alike.

Key words: visual communication, graphic design, pictogram, non-profit organization, social networking sites

## The building of the Langhans Palace

Since the 1880, the house at 37 Vodičkova Street in Prague has been associated with photography. It was named after Jan Langhans, a prominent Czech portraitist. He lived in 1851–1928. He studied food chemistry, but his passion for photography was stronger. That is why he established a small studio in Jindřichův Hradec in 1876 .From there, after four years, he moved to Prague, where he founded a portrait studio - Atelier Langhans.

An innovative approach, precise craftsmanship and artistic processing and very strong marketing for its time soon turned the studio into the largest photographic plant in the Czech Republic. Jan Langhans has participated in national and international exhibitions, won many awards, including the Order of the Persian Shah and the King of England. He also became the chairman of the Czech Photographic Association.

In the 1948, Atelier Langhans was nationalized on the basis of a decree on the socialization of services. The then Czechoslovakia thus suffered an enormous cultural loss.
 
After the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, the property was returned to the descendants of Jan Langhans. However, as a result of the socialist government's neglected property care, the family was handed over a completely ruined building.

`The building of Langhans before a reconstruction.`

In the years 2001 and 2002 there was a reconstruction according to the design of the architect Ladislav Lábus. The reconstruction achieved a harmonious conection between modern architecture and history.

## The current Logo and communication

The current logo of the Center is purely typographic and consists of a capital bold inscription *LANGHANS* supplemented by the *CENTER OF PEOPLE IN NEED*, or in the second variant *CAFE IN THE CENTER*. The inscription Langhans is distinctive by the missing upper quarter of the letters and the absence of crossbars at letter *A*. It is defined primarily in white on a almost black background.

`The current logo.`

The logo is the only unifying graphic element of the visual communication of the Langhans Center. It is used as a profile picture on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. However, even these profile photos are not completely uniform. We can find a black and white variant of the logo only on Twitter, but on the other social networks they are working with a variant where the dark gray background is replaced by a photo of a blue outdoor table. That is why the logo loses its legibility.

The Langhans Center communicates with the public mainly through Instagram, Facebook and Twitter profile. The posts mostly concern the promotion of the café and the products they offer, as well as information on the activities of People in Need and the upcoming events held in the Center. 

Photos are probably taken on the phone, they do not have a sufficient quality and thus do not inspire trust, especially if we are talking about gastronomic posts. The content is not visually unified, the photographs do not carry a constant tonality of colors, which is important to create an overall harmonic impression.
