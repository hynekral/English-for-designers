#### Five Things I Learned This Semester

I learned the importance of content in any work of art or design.
I learned how to use GitHub (and write Markdown).
I learned (well, Iâ€™m still learning) how to use Slack.
I learned that it is possible to have a teacher who considers students equal to himself and treats everyone as an individual.
I learned how important it is to express oneself in a clear, descriptive, and concise way.
